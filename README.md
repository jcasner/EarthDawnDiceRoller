# Earthdawn Dice Roller

After playing in an [Earthdawn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthdawn) campaign recently, one of the frustrations that I felt coming from the D&D world was the need to convert from "Step" to Dice. In an admittedly nerdy effort to simplify gaming while also learning react-native, I put this simple app together. Sure, there are other apps out there that do the same thing. But this seemed like a fun way to learn something new.
